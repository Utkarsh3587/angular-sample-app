ng-app-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS app
============

This project is an application skeleton for a typical Angularjs, Ecmascript6, SASS web app. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your project.

- The seed contains a sample AngularJS application by using Angularjs, Ecmascript6, SASS for Frontend.
- And Nodejs on Server side.
- In this seed [consolidate][consolidate] are used for `HTML` engine with [express][express].
- [gulp][gulp] is used for task runner.
- The seed app has much thing, just to show how dist file system works.

For better clearance we work on `src` folder and serve files from `public` folder.
Also we have used so many tools to automate our work. for Eg. you don't need to include manually any library or files in your html file. we have used [gulp-inject][gulp-inject] tool to complete it

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the ng-app-seed repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the ng-app-seed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test ng-app-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone ng-app-seed

Clone the ng-app-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/sarfarazansari/ng-app-seed.git
cd ng-app-seed
```


If you just want to start a new project without the ng-app-seed commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sarfarazansari/ng-app-seed.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.


### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

```
npm install
```

* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

```
bower install
```

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `bower_components` - contains the angular framework files


### ENV setting

Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and make settings according to your need.


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with gulp task runner.  The simplest way to start server on `dev mode` is:

```
gulp run
```

*Note that the `gulp run` command take care of all other related tasks. 

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:5000`.

or on `prod mode`:

```
gulp prod
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`.


## Directory Layout

It's a mixture of moduler app and MVC pattern.
- All .js, .scss files will be concatinate separately in single file and later compile for serve.
